are to be ascribed exclusit-ely to bis own invention, it is nov
impossible to say. Those only can with certainty be considered
as such, which refer to incidents that happened in his own time.
His chief merit lies in a certain clem-nese and conciseness os style,
peculim-ly adapted to the kind of composition he baa chosea- His
language‚ too, with some few exceptione, ia aa pure and correct u
could be expected even from a writer os the Augustan age.

The kind os verse employed by Phaedrus is what is called
the sanabit: trimeter, consisting of a combination of six iambi,
whence it is tei-med in Latin senarius, nnd in Greek trimeter, two
united feet forming a metrum οι· dipodia. To relieve the monotony
os pure iambic feet, however, the place of nn iambus υ - may be
supplied by a tribrachys υ υ ι.. , a sponda - -‚ a daceyl — υ υ,
or an anapaese o ν -, in every place except the last, which must
always be an iambus, or, as the lust syllable of all verses is anceps
—that is, long or short—a pyrrhic, o o . To exemplify thia, we
subjoin four lines of the first sable of Phaedrus, divided into single
feet and meires.
