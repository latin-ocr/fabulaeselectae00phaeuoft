mnan 111. 35

Si testis alius, judex alius denique,

Dignum faterer esse mc tantis malis,

N ec his dolorem delenirem remediis,

Suspicione si quis errabit sua, 45

Et rapiet ad se, quod erit commune omnium,

Stulte nudabit animi conscientiam.

Huic excusatum mc velim nihilominus z

Verum ipsam vitam et mores hominum ostendere. 50
Rem me professum dicet fors aliquis gravem.

Cur somno inerti deseram patriae decus 2 55

Threissa quum gens numeret auctores suos,

Linoque Apollo sit parcns, Musa Orpheo,

latter being sent as governor to Eg) ·p‚t he obtained the sole com—

a complete ascendancy over Tiberius, and privatcly aimed at the
imperial power, having full scope for his machinationis after the
emperor had abandoned himself to luxury and debauchery at
Capreae. Phaedrus appears to have been one of the victims of
his oppression. The apprehensions of Tiberius were at length,
however, exeited; the former favourite was superseded by another
in the command of the praetorian bands, and soon after put to
death by a decree of the senate. See Introduction—45. διαεμσιοιιιῑ
