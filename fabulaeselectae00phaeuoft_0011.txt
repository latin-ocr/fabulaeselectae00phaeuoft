lines 33-503 into the ninth sable, lines 3 and 43 and added an
epilogue. Eutychus at this time held the office of judge, and in
the epilogue Phaedrus importunes him, so far as consistent with
the duties imposed on him by his official oath, to exert his
influence for his liberation. The date of his imprisonment is
unknown3 but that its duration must have been considerable, is
evident from his stating, in his application to Eutychus, that those
who had held office before him had not interfered in his behalf,
and that, in the order of appointments, his place would soon 110
occupied by a successor. The friendly aid of Eutychus was pro-
bably not required, for about this time Seianus was put to death,
together with many of his relatives and confederates, aud Phaedrus
may be supposed to have easily regained his wished-for liberty.
Freed from confinement and peril, and being already an old man,
he resolved on terminating his poetic labours. He no longer
required such a pastime as a source of solace for his private
wrongs. Covetous of praise, however, and finding that his fame
was in the ascendant, he resumed his favourite oceupation, and
published a Fourth and a Fifth Book, dedicating the former to
Particulo, and the latter to Philetus. Of these patrons of the
fabulist we know nothing, except what we learn from these dedi-
cations; but from their names, they, 35 well as Eutychus, seem 10
have been either Greeks, or of Greek extraction.

Various conjectures have been hazarded regarding 1110 probable
period of the death of Phaedrus, but all are equally unworthy of
reliance. That he lived 10 311 advanced age is manifest, however,
from his own statements. The casual 'hints furnished by his
F ables present 1115 character in an amiable light. He had no desire
for the acquisition of wealth. The leading aim of his literary
labours, was to correct the errors and promote the good-humour of
mankind. He was passionately devoted to literature, and fond of
the approbation of the discriminating. He bore his confinement
with patience and fortitude, and relieved its irksomeness by
converse with the Muses.

The works of Phaedrus are comprised in five books of Fables,
which he professes partly to have invented, and partly to have
translated from Greek originale. These Greek originals passed
under the name of Aesop‚ of whom scarcely anything is known.
He appears to have lived about 570 B.c.; but whether 110 left
written works or not, is matter of dispute. It 15 00113111, 11131
fables bearing his name were current 31 Athens in its most iutel-
lcctual age. Socrates, who died 399 B.c.‚ is said to have turned
some of them into verse as a means of beguiling the tedium of his
imprisonment. At a later period, 320 ss.c., Demetrius Phalereus
busied himself with the same task. Many of these sables have
been lost. Only in the ease of thirty have we the means of com-
paring Phaedrus with his originals3 and although, in one or two
instances, there is a manifest improvement, yet, on the whole, it
must be allowed that he suffers by the comparison. How many
