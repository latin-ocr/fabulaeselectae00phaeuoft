PREFAGE.

As an initiatory class-book, the Fables of PrrAnnRUs are known
to present a combination of advantages not to be found in any
other Latin classic. The nature of the subject is well suited to
youthful minds. The narrative arrests their attention without
wearying it by undue prolixity. Few difficulties can occur in
comprehending the meaning, for the style is in general simple and
perspicuous. The moral is calculated to lead to habits of reflec-
tion, not the less determinate, perhaps, that the mind is uncon-
scious of the impulse. The text adopted in the present edition,
is that of Dressler (Leipsic, 1850)—undcubtedly the best that
has yet appeared. Such fables are of course omitted as seemed
unfit for the perusalss'of youth. The assistance derived from
many valuable editions of Phaedrus, but particularly those
of Burmann and Schwabe, is here gratefully acknowledged. In
the notes, the object aimed at, and it is hoped, attained‚ was to
remove the difficulties which experience in teaching pointed
out to us as being the most likely to retard the progress of the
learner. Inverted sentences have generally been construed;
particular attention has been paid to prevent confusion regarding
the characters in the dialogue3 the mythological and historieal
notes have been made as full as space would admit, with the
hope of exciting a desire sor further knowledge3 and if it be
objected that philological points and other matters have been
in'cidentally glanced at, which are not strictly required for the
pupi] at this stage of his progress, it is hopcd that such details
may not prove altogether unacceptablc to the teaeher.

A copious Vocabulary, including proper names and adjectives‚
has been appended to the present edition of Phaedrus, in order
