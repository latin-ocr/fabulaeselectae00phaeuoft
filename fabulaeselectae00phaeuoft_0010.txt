vi INTRODUCTION.

Tiberius, Phaedrus was visited with serious calamities. These
were, to a certain extent, no doubt sels-incurred, but the penalty
was disproportionate to the ofl'ence. Augustus patronbed, but
Tiberius, the new emperor, disliked men of genius, and sor
this there were obvious reasons· The inhuman deeds which
commenced with his assumption of the purple, were but faint
indicatione of the atrocities which afterwards characterised his
reign. Despots have ever been averse to all who either ex-
posed their barbarities or ridiculed their actions; and whether
the poet, in any of his sables, had pointed personal reference or
not to Tiberius, or any of his minions, suspicion was excited
against him, and what would have passed under a milder and
more liberal sway as the effusion of sportive wit, was construed
into expressions of intentional and malet-olent defamation.
Among the first who took this view ot' the writings of Phaedrus
was Aelius Seianus, the friend and confidunt os the emperor, and
sor many years the real governor οἲ the state. The first two
books os our author‘s sables were pubhshed, but without a dedi-
cation, while this profligate individua! was in the height of his
power. This we should dcem an imprudent step on the part of
Phaedrus, ir', in the circumstances of the period, they contained
allusions which could be construed in no other light than as
animadversionis on the conduct either of Tiberius or his proti—(76.
The fablc which may be supposed to have first given offence, is the
sixth os the Second Book, in which a slave, one of the iuuet-hall
keepers os Tiberius, is humorously aad satirically portrayed‚ aad
the emperor himselt¹ mentioned in terms scarcely consistent with
the courtesy due to imperial power. To persons disposed to
criminate, the second t'ahle of the First Book about Jupiter aud
the srogs, would rcadil>¹ appear to be an unpardonable caricature
os Tiberius and his governinent3 while the sixth suble of the
same hook might hc regarded as having unmistakable reference to
the expected marriage ot' Seianus with the unscrupulous Livia.
Phaedrus himself admits. indeed, in the prologue to the Third Book,
that he was the cause os his own mistortunes3 but he at the name
time emphatically asserts, that the object of his suble: was not to
unmask particular iinlividuals, but to dcpict the livea and eha-
racters os men in general. llis intention, however, was differently
viewed hy others, sor from the sante prologue it appears that
Seianus, in the threet'old character os accuser, witness, and judge,
had straincd every nervo to convict him of tremon. In thiu,
indeed, his arraigner saihd, sor the only sables on which nn
impeachment could ho loun-led, were only Latinised veniunt of
