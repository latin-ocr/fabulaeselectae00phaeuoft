INTRODUGTION.

ΑΗ, our authentic information regarding the life of Phaedrus,
consists of incidental notices collected from his own writings. As
these notices are chiefly allusions to his social character and
condition, they necessarily furnish few data for a detailed and
regular memoir. From these materials, however, meagre as they
are, his editors have from time to time drawn some ingenious
inferences; but deductions of this nature, however high their
probability, must in every case fall short of the certainty of fact.
The title of his fables, Prummu, AUGUSTI LIBERTI, FABULAE
ABSONAE, shews not only that he was originally a slave, but also
that Augustus had granted him manumission. In the prologue to
the third book, he mentions Mount Pierus as his birthplace‚ which,
in the time of this emperor, belonged to Macedonia3 and from the
same prologue, it appears that he did not consider himself a Greek,
for in speaking of Aesop and Anacharsis, the former a Phrygian‚
and the latter a Scythian, he merely claims the distinction of
being nearer to ‘lettered Greece ⁷ than they. The question,
whether he was a slave by birth, or had become so by circum-
stances, is one which we have no means of determim'ng. A like
uncertainty attaches not only to his age at the time of his arrival
in Rome, but also to the particular period itsels. It is clear,
however, from his own statement in the POETA, Book Third, and
from a. quotation which he there makes from the Telephus of
Ennius, that to whatever country he owes his birth, he had
directed his attention to Roman literature from his boyhood. His
study of the Latin language may have been commenced in his
own country, and afterwards completed in the imperial city; but
in any case, the elegance of his diction, and his knowledge of
idiom, bear ample testimony to his perseverance and success. Of
the circumstances of his introduction into the slave retinue of
Augustus, we can affirm nothing either from fact or conjecturc;
but it may be safely assumed, that his attachment to letters,
his great mental endowments, and the integrity of his life,
appeared to this prominent patron of literature sufficient grounds
for granting him his freedom.
